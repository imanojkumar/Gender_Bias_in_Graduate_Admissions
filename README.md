DataCamp Project: Gender Bias in Graduate Admissions

1. Welcome to Berkeley

It's 1973, and – as one of the top-ranked universities in the United States – Berkeley has attracted thousands of applicants to its graduate school. But how many made the cut?

We will start off by loading the UCBAdmissions dataset, which is included in base R. This shows the number of students – male and female – who were admitted or rejected from the six largest departments at Berkeley. Since the dataset takes the unwieldly form of a three-dimensional array, we will convert it to tidy format using the tidy function from the tidytext package. Then we will be ready to start doing some analysis.
